            <p>Tour de France is known as "The most prestigious and most difficult bicycle race" in the world. It is one of the three grand tours, other being Giro d'Italia and  Vuelta a España. The race consists of 21 day-long stages over the course of 23 days. The race mostly takes part in France, but also passes through some of nearby countries. The race covers around 3,500 kilometres (2,200miles)</p>
            <p>The race takes place every year in the month of july, where it starts at Nice and ends at Champs-Élysées in Paris. The route changes each year but the format stays the same which makes the race more exciting.</p>
            <p>Every year around 20-22 teams participate consisting of 8 riders in each. The race is divided in multiple stages and timed to finish, every rider's times are compounded with their previous stages times. The rider with lowest cumulative time is the leader of the race and gets to wear the yellow jersey. The tour also consists different competitions such as   the "points classification" for the sprinters, the "mountains classification" for the climbers, "young rider classification" for riders under the age of 26, and the "team classification", based on the first three finishers from each team on each stage.</p>

            <h2>The Rivalry</h2>
            <p>The tour de France actually started from rivalry between two newspapers in France. The event began as a promotional event by newspaper, L'Auto. L'Auto's editor was  Henri Desgrange, champion cyclist and owner with Victor Goddet of the velodrome at the Parc des Princes. The event was the brainchild of chief cycling journalist, 26 year old, Géo Lefèvre. In those days, Long-distance cycle races were a popular means to sell more newspapers. Lefèvre's initial suggestion was a 6-day race of sort on popular track around France, the race of this length had not been attempted before it. Desgrange was doubtful at the start but Victor Goddet, paper's financial director was enthusiastic.</p>

        <section id="Paragraph-3">
            <h2>Initial Arrangements</h2>
            <p>The first tour de France commenced in 1903. The plan was to have a five stage race from 31st may to 5th july, starting in Paris and stopping in Lyon(290 miles/ 467kms), Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, and Nantes before returning to Paris. Stages would experience the night and finish next evening, with rest days before riders set off once more. But this proved too disconcerting and cost too much with only 15 participants willing to race. Desgrance came close to dropping the idea, instead he cut the length of the race to 19 days and changed the dates from 1st to 19th July. He even offered daily allowance to riders who averaged 20 km/hr (12 mph) on all stages. Entry fee was reduced to 10 francs from 20 francs. First prize of 12,000 francs was announced along with prize money of  3,000 francs to each stage's winner. In this manner, the champion would win six times of what most laborers earned in a year.</p>
            <p>This attracted around 60 to 80 participants from France, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, including professionals, team riders, amateurs, some unemployed and some adventurers. Among the participants were eventual winner, Maurice Garin, his rival Hippolyte Aucouturier, the German favourite Josef Fischer.</p>

            <p>The first tour de France started outside cafe Reveil-Matin at the junction of the Melun and Corbeil roads in the village of Montgeron. Due to the physical effort the tour required many of the participants dropped out in initial stages. Only 24 participants remained at the end of the fourth stage. The race completed on the edge of Paris at Ville d'Avray, outside the Restaurant du Père Auto, before a ceremonial ride into Paris and a few laps of the Parc des Princes.</p>
            <p>Around 10,000 spectators witnessed Frenchman Maurice Garin, "the little chimney sweep", who dominated throughout the race cross finish line at Parc des Princes. The last racer finished two days behind him.</p>

            <h2>Aftermath</h2>
            <p>L'Auto's strategy was successful as circulation of publication doubled throughout the race, making the race much larger than Desgrange had ever hoped. The following year their rival Le Velo went out of business. </p>
