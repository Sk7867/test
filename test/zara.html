            <p>Today, you might be aware of so many fashion labels, be it from huge Billboards or some creative ad campaign that left its impression on you. But one brand that has managed to stay at the top without using such commonly applied marketing strategies, yet making its founder, the richest man on earth, is none other than ZARA.</p>
            <p><b>“Beauty, clarity, Functionality and Sustainability”</b></p>
            <p>The company vows to define its structure with these four core values. With Fast fashion as its unsaid motto, the label is so much more than what meets its customers’ eyes. The parent company, INDITEX has established nearly 3000 ZARA stores alone, across the globe. In India, Zara has 22 functioning stores, and operates through its parent groups association with Tata firm Trent Ltd. And now, with the social media revolution, people don’t want to lose out on the latest trends. Zara has pioneered and perfected its business model to provide this.  Incremental sales of the company has knocked off those of the luxury brands. While many claim that this is due to the latest fashion made available at affordable prices, the expensiveness of the clothing items is subjective, because cost of product is not cut down or varied for the countries having low labor wages. But worldwide, Zara seems to dominate the fashion market with a brand value of $18.4. Billion.</p>

            <h2>The Humble billionaire</h2>
            <p>Currently, ZARA has opened stores in 96 countries and is expanding faster than ever. But, how and where exactly did it all begin?</p>
            <p>In La Coruña, a beautiful coastal city in the northwest region of Spain, when a boy heard his mother pleading for credits at a local store to buy groceries, he decided to leave school at the age of 14 to provide for his family by running errands at a retail clothing shop. The boy’s name was Amancio Ortega Gaona. He learned to make clothes while working at a shop called ‘Gala’, which still is very much active in the city, but now the visitors are more interested in this boy. Initially, he used to deliver fabrics to other sellers but later around 1960, became Senior Manager of the store. Designing clothes or modifying the leftovers at his sister’s place, when out of work, is what helped him in evolving his taste in fashion. He used to design nightgowns and lingerie and sell them in the same retail shop.</p>
            <p>He started his first business,‘Confecciones GOA’ (his initials placed backwards), in 1963, along with his wife and siblings, which specialized in bathrobes, nightwear, baby clothes, etc., with an initial investment capital of $25. The business grew and with lack of more family members to work, he gathered women across the province into sewing cooperatives. But the company had no brand of its own as it supplied clothes to other retailers. Spain’s political climate made him hesitate to start his own stamp, as the country was still under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco,  the nationalist general who had seized power after the Spanish Civil war. There were very tight dress-code regulations. At that time, very few women participated in the workforce, which meant that most of his clients wouldn’t have a lot of money to spend on clothes. But with Franco’s death, totalitarian Spain also died. The 1970s saw sweeping social and economic reforms across Spain, which revitalized the nation.</p>
            <p>In 1975, he along with his former wife, Rosalie Ameri opened their first retail shop, ZORBA, which was named after the couple’s favourite movie, ‘Zorba, the Greek’. But shortly, after getting to know that there was a bar with the exact same name, a few blocks away, they decided to change it. Within the already purchased letter moulds, he came up with ZARA. And as they say, every cloud has a silver lining, the timing and approach to ZARA were perfect to help kickstart the brand. ZARA attracted more customers because it sold fashionable clothes at reasonable prices, which is still enacted by the label. In 1985, he felt ready to expand internationally, which is why he incorporated the company into a holding group called ‘Industria de Diseno Textil’, shortly INDITEX which now includes all the other brands like Pull&Bear, Bershka,  Zara Home, Massimo Dutti, Oysho, Stradivarius and Uterqüe. Market Value of Inditex group is evaluated around $79.3 Billion as of May 2020.. Ortega didn't get an office made for himself. Rather he just likes to brainstorm with the designers, even now after his retirement.</p>
            <p><b>“I just want to live a normal life and be able to sip coffee with my wife in the piazza with nobody paying attention to me. ”</b></p>
            <p>The founder is a very simple man, who is always seen in white crisp shirt and a blue blazer every day. He enjoys his privacy and pays a hefty amount to have it that way. He stands at 6th position on Forbes’ Billionaires 2020 at the age of 84, with net worth of $55.1 Billion as of July 2020.</p>

            <h2>Expansion</h2>
            <p><b>“Grow or die. If you want to innovate, don’t focus on the results.”</b></p>
            <p>Ortega has stayed true to his statement. Within a few years of its establishment, Inditex, the parent company of ZARA turned into the largest textile group with stores on the most expensive streets of the world. In 1988, he opened his first store outside Spain in Porto, Portugal, which was a success. Later Ortega decided to expand in New York in 1989 and Paris in 1990. Over the course of the 1990s, ZARA established 550 new stores universally.</p>
            <p>In 2000, a new headquarter was built in Arteixo. Inditex got listed as a public company in 2001, after Amancio Ortega planned to retire with 59% shares under his ownership, and with the company shares available on the Madrid stock exchange and also included in blue chip stock indices such as the Ibex 35, FTSE Eurotop 100 and the Euro Stoxx 600. In almost every largest city or capital, you can find an Inditex store. In 2002, ‘forandfor’ program was launched for people with disabilities. In 2003, Zara expanded into interiors by launching Zara Home. In 2004, the parent company had opened 2000 stores worldwide. Since 2005, they have been opening stores with a rate of over more than one a day, with a total of 7490 stores. In 2010, the company made a revenue of 12.5 billion with just two times a year, paper commercials. In 2011, the first Zara flagship was inaugurated in Australia, making it into 5 continents of the world. Amancio Ortega has achieved the title of World’s richest man more than three times surpassing Bill Gates,even if it was for a brief period of time.</p>

        <section id="Paragraph-4">
            <h2>Fast Fashion</h2>
            <p>Fast fashion is a series of chain retailers who look at the runways and make trendy clothes fast, cheap and disposable. Zara has said to have moulded this business strategy. Generally legacy brands release huge amounts of clothes in a few seasonal releases. They spend months designing lines, buying and treating fabrics manufactured in bulk and distributing, which can take upto 2 years. Zara can move from identifying a trend to having clothes on its shelves in less than 30 days. This acts as a sore point for its competitors as Zara is quick in terms of interpreting trends that are on the runway and selling at far less price.</p>
            <p><b>Sounds Illegal?</b></p>
			<p>How do the fast fashion labels escape from duplicating the designs from runaways or styles from luxury brands? This technique of knocking off a design rapidly, self production of raw materials and manufacturing the product, if it is selling well in the market, is actually different from counterfeit. In counterfeit, Brand logos, symbols of the companies that originally made the item are also replicated. This is where they face issues, while the fast fashion companies create similar styles or fashion inspired from their designs. The designs developed are distinct enough to not get confronted with any copyright issues.</p>
			<p>Few key points that help zara shape up this strategy are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>●	<b>Vertical Integration:</b>
					<p>The company controls or owns the supply chains, from manufacturing to end of the sale. Zara takes matter into its own hand with 60% of self production of clothing. Design, production, shipment, display, promotion, sales and feedback is coordinated and controlled by the company. The design team, complex fabric sourcing, cutting, dying and sewing facilities can be found at the headquarter in Spain. Due to such management, there is a rapid product turnover.</p>
				</li>
				<li>●	<b>Dynamic assortment:</b>
					<p>With every next visit of customers, a huge segment of items is changed. The agenda is to sell new things almost everyday. Inditex supplies its stores two or even three times a week. Not all shops sell the same quantity of each type of apparel. The headquarters has a control over how much and what kind of pieces are to be sent to each of the group's shops: the model, the colour, the size, etc. So, considering this data, the stores receive pieces of clothing as appropriate for their individual needs.</p>
				</li>
				<li>●	<b>Solid distribution chain:</b>
					<p>They can convey their products to any of their stores in less than 48 hours, 24 hours,fty within Europe. A huge part of its  dissemination is handled at its operating room in Arteixo, a small town in Galicia, which can be referred to as the company's brain. In this room, they control daily analysis, logistics, new designs, and breakdown everything that takes place across all of the company’s stores, in real-time. Most of the manufacturing process takes place in factories near the headquarters, though a part of clothing production takes place in countries like Morocco, Bangladesh, Turkey, Brazil, almost everything goes to Spain before it is sent to stores. But why the long run? The products are always on the go, meaning they are not stored, they are sorted and distributed, which in turn reduces the stock in storage as well as storage space in the shops. Less stock in the stores means less frozen money and less storage space means more space for sales which gives rise to more money. Zara has built a warehouse, which is 5 million square feet, almost  9 times than that of Amazon's. Optical yet automatic reading devices sort out and distribute more than 60,000 items of clothing an hour. Zara’s merchandise does not have to waste time waiting for human sorting. Zara's production centralization gives the organization an upper hand by limiting the lead-time of their merchandise with regards to item distribution. This is practical because of the close proximities of the distribution centre in Arteixo and their industrial facilities in Coruña.</p>
				</li>
				<li>●	<b>Quick response manufacturing:</b>
					<p>The brand has to keep track of current trends, hence there is always an eye around streets, universities, and other places to get an overview of their customer’s choices. In this way,   Zara's designers are in constant touch with the customers. It takes 15 days for a Zara garment to go from the design stage to hanging in the store. They annually design 40,000 designs out of which only 12000 reach the shops, which tallies down to 1000 designs a month. 85% of production is finished during the season, with a creation rate of around 50% of its product line in the middle of the season. With the production and design team of 200 people,every individual is almost liable for 60 designs a year. Since numerous designs are manufactured in less time, each design contributes very less, individually, towards net revenue, and moreover is not cost-efficient in terms of product and design development. However, higher profit margins will be adequate compensation for the company.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>●	<b>No more lasting collections:</b>
					<p>In the company, clothes are often renewed,  on average, every Fortnight. So if a specific item is not contributing to any sales , it vanishes from the shelves, never to be seen again.. However, if any item is very much liked by the customers, its production is limited to a short period of time, so customers are assured that many people won't be wearing the same outfit. The designers recycle the model, the essence of the product is kept but modifications are made, likely in less than two weeks, so trends are followed but are not repeated. Due to this, there is a development of a ‘see-now-buy-now’ kind of retail environment, which gives rise to scarcity and urgency. Collection is often updated according to the sale but only about 18% of Inditex clothing requires discount, while other retailers’ average stands around 35%. It gets around 85% of the full price on its clothes, while the industry average is 65%.</p>

            <h2>Focus On rental locations and no marketing</h2>
            <p>The company does not spend any of its revenue on marketing, rather is known for investing its capitals in the beauty, historical appeal and location of its shops. You will find close to none advertisements or campaigns as investment is 0-0.3 % there is no marketing team assigned for setting up ads. The one time that Zara was seen covering the front page of NewYork times, was when it purchased a plot in 666 Avenue in Manhattan, NewYork, the costliest building in the Capital State.The company claims that the piece was not an advertisement, rather just information to celebrate the purchase. Another technique is to find places for its store establishment near the Luxury brands like Gucci or Prada, while the later prefer it the other way around, as Zara is more likely to capture their customer’s attention with its price tags.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Paragraph-6">
            <h2>Environment friendly decisions</h2>
            <p>Zara says 90 percent of its stores are eco-accommodating. As the Fashion business is liable for as much as 20% of worldwide ozone harming substance emmisions. It signed up the United Nations (UN) Global Compact in 2001, which was a progression of five-year key environmental plans; aligning itself to the turn of events and utilization of mindfully and economically sustainable fabrics; transforming its shops and offices so they're eco-proficient; reusing packaging and utilizing green choices for its pressing materials; an in-store recycling donation program; and propelling its eco-cognizant Join Life collection which, the executives uncovered, accounts of 20% of Zara's offerings. Join life could be simply described as <b>“a selection made from more sustainable raw materials using processes that help take care of the environment.”</b></p>
            <p>Even though it is said that Ortega came in terms with this strategy due to lack of education, it seems to have changed the design curve of the apparel market.</p>
