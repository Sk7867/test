            <p>Amul derives its name from Sanskrit word “Amoolya” which means priceless. It is one of the most successful and major Indian brands is especially known for its milk products. Amul has been recognized by its famous jingle “utterly butterly delicious” and the charming mascot, “the Amul girl”. People have grown up watching and listening to the girl and the jingle on hoardings and advertisements. Amul, founded in 1946 has been the most trusted, beloved, and esteemed brand of India ever since and it has come a long way since its foundation.</p>

        <section id="Paragraph-2">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Amul had its seeds sown 74 years ago at Anand district in the state of Gujarat. The farmers of Kaira were depended on Seasonal crops for their income, and during the off-season, they were deprived of food and faced starvation. Since the milk market was completely in the hands of contractors and middlemen, their income from milch buffaloes was unreliable. They were often asked to sell their milk at low or whatever price they were offered by contractors and then later sold at much higher prices by private companies. They sought help from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to stop the exploitation by private companies.</p>
            <p> Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel asked them to eliminate middlemen and to undertake a strike. Due to such injustice and unfair practices, farmers called off for a “milk strike” for about 15 days. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had an insight to completely get rid of middlemen and to form a co-operative movement by the farmers. He wanted to have farmers complete control over the milk market and a co-operative that would have procurement, processing, and marketing. Hence, under the inspiration and guidance of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Morarji Desai, and Tribhuvandas Patel a co-operative society was formed on 14th December 1946. This movement was called “the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producer’s Union Limited” (KDCMPUL) which was successfully led by farmers to eradicate unfair trade practices by Polson and Polson Dairy. The movement grew and later in 1973 it formed into Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF). The Union started producing 250 litres/day of milk with just a handful of farmers from two villages. Along with the success of the movement, more farmers started to join the milk societies. And with around 432 farmers, the production of milk increased to 5000 litres/day.</p> 
			<p>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel wanted to lay the foundation of dairy equipment for the union and hence he asked Dr. Verghese Kurien to help him lay the dairy. Dr. Verghese Kurien from being a civil engineer was known to become the largest milk producer in the world. He was acknowledged as “Father of White Revolution” or “Dudhwala of India”. Kurien has been at the various positions throughout his career starting as Executive Head Of Kaira union in 1950 to founder chairman of the National Dairy Development Board from 1965 to 1998. He also led the “Operation Flood” the largest dairy development program in the world. He has also served GCMMF for more than 30 years and has been credited for success of Amul marketing. Dr. Verghese Kurien helped from the foundation of Kaira Union to leading the brand “Amul” today. With such a rare vision and dedication of Dr.Verghese Kurien, Amul has become the largest and most successful milk producing brand today.</p>
