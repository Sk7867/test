        <p>If you are in the mood to watch a gooey-ish movie sitting comfy and feeling soft, 'The Intern' is a perfect choice starring Robert De Niro as Ben, Anne Hathaway as Jukes Austin, and Rene Russo as Fiona. The film's story, direction and production was done by Nancy Meyers. It is a movie where every character is likeable, their flaws and shortcomings are enhanced in a way that everything seems elegant, which is why it is not a movie in which you pay attention to reasoning but rather just of a type watch-movie-eat-icecream-feel-good.</p>
        <p>The plot revolves around a charming 70 years old, widowed, polite in nature man, gracefully portrayed by De Niro, somewhat different than most of his characters, who finds himself a bit annoyed by a routine of doing nothing and signs himself up for the challenge of working at an online clothing firm as an intern. Acing the interview he leaves an impression on everyone and is selected to assist the CEO, played by Anne Hathaway. She is a character with a bit of everything, hardworking, sweet and most of all easy to go. The relationship between Ben and Jules is portrayed so well, the phases of growth and the way they blend, tense at points but most of the moments manage to get a smile on your face, and if you are emotional just like me, maybe some tears here and there.</p>
        <p>She is dealing with a few problems herself, which are very much realistic but her battling them with a beautiful smile on her face gives a different level of energy to the movie. Her emotions are a bit delicate towards Ben, and, looking at him who wouldn't feel soft? He is filled with grace, a person with morals and decency, tactful communication, but the age-y appearance that strikes you to behave in a particular manner and not order him around, is the same that initially limits Jules behaviour towards him. But that's the beauty of the flick, it makes you reason with the characters.  Ben's age factor and living life make him more observant, which somehow irks Jules. With the turn of events and Ben working carefully through sensibility and cautiously helping her in things helps them evolve their bond of friendship. watching Ben interacting with office colleagues or just talking to Jule's lovely daughter is something, you could watch all day. </p>
        <p>Another really pleasant part of the film is the way it showcases the hardships that a career-oriented woman faces while working and managing home, simultaneously. The kind of understanding that Ben imparts for the difficulties that Jules is going through, and that might be due to the many experiences he had in his life, helps shape up the movie perfectly. And even though for most of the part, he is shown as a wise and old, humble and knowledgeable man, the trait of learning that his character is given is astonishing and what makes us only like him more. The way he learns technology and gadgets, he is learning about the working style of Austin, and not sticking with general things that an old man would do, rather pipes up his energy and works hard. He is a figure that all the company staff, at least the ones around him look up to, his demeanour, discipline and tactics. The movie itself is very unique, with things happening that don't seem unworkable, rather just different, and leave you feeling warm and happy within.</p>
