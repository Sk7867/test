        <p>Titli is a 2014 Hindi  movie written and directed by Kanu Behl, and produced by Dibakar Banerjee and Aditya Chopra. It stars Ranvir Shorey, Amit Sial, Shashank Arora, Lalit Behl and Shivani Raghuvanshi in the lead roles.In Titli, Behl catches the unpredictability of a society where savagery lies just beneath the surface.</p>
        <p>Titli played by Shashank Arora is the youngest family member from a brutal vehicle jacking group in Delhi with his siblings, eldest sibling Vikram played by Ranveer Shorey and middle brother Pradeep acted by Amit Sial. Titli plans to escape from his family business of vehicle jacking and malicious things and their profession. While endeavoring to get away from the grasp of his siblings with 300,000 rupees in his bag, Titli incidentally crashes a car before a police checkpoint. This resulted in Pradeep and Titli getting grabbed by police. When they are discharged the following day, Titli discovers that the police have taken the cash from his bag and he admits to his siblings that he was about to flee and put the cash in a parking garage business. </p>
        <p>Vikram forces Titli to get hitched to Neelu acted by Shivani Raghuvanshi to help control him and furthermore to bring a lady into the gang to be utilized as a cover. Neelu, even though married to Titli, pines for her darling Prince acted by Prashant Singh, a well off rich man she is having an affair with. What follows later is the family drama in the life of Titli and in his love life with Neelu.</p>
        <p>Titli's screenplay is so incredibly crafted that it grasps you by the collar, and makes you live all that is going on the screen.Ranvir Shorey as Vikram acted brilliantly. It can be stated as one of his best performances of his life.Shashank Arora as the sad, impartial Titli as acted splendidly.His face conveys what is required when there are no dialogues. He is each piece of  a pathetic adolescent whose fantasies are squashed under a heap of rough turns of events. Amit Sial(we have seen him in web series like Mirzapur and Inside Edge) is perfect for the character that is required in the film. Shivani Raghuvanshi has a perfect face for Neelu's character, and she has done justice to it.Actors like this need more acknowledgment and chances so we get the chance to see a greater amount of craft. The direction is top notch. Titli gives you a brief look at the world which exists even in big cities like Mumbai or Delhi.</p>
        <p>Some of its scenes leave a strong impact on your mind even after you are done watching it  . Like the one where Vikram is contending with his better half in the beginning and abusing the driver/worker simultaneously . Another scene where Vikram is thrashing Titli after he comes to realize that he was fleeing with 300,000 Rs. Another such scene is where the family is doing their typical business alongside Neelu (without her knowledge or concern) of vehicle jacking and in that they slaughter the salesman. There are various such scenes, for example, when Titli takes his significant other Neelu to his lover's house , when they are married or the scene where an argument happens among Neelu and Titli.It is written by Sharat Katariya and Kanu Behl. It is written perfectly exploring many plots within a movie .Kanu Behl has portrayed and directed the film with sheer brilliance.The music by Karan Gour suits the plot appropriately.</p>
        <p>With an IMDB rating of 7.6 and 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes , Titli is one of its own sort since it is about a world that exists together right with our own, a world corresponding with our own . A world that we do overlook however we will always remember while travelling alone at night . All we could say is Titli is one of its sort . This one has its own flaws and is wonderful in its own way.You won't be disappointed.</p>
