        <p>Haider is a 2014 Indian crime drama movie written, produced and directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, produced by Siddharth Roy Kapur, and co-written by Basharat Peer. It stars Shahid Kapoor and Tabu as lead, alongside Shraddha Kapoor and Kay Menon. Irrfan shows up in unique appearance.Haider is the third part of Bhardwaj's Shakespearean set of trilogy after Maqbool (2003) and Omkara (2006).</p>
        <p>The movie is set in 1995, in the midst of militancy and military principle, this Kashmir is dark smoke and covered by frozen water flames gleaming furiously on a lake. In 1995, during the revolt in Kashmir, Hilaal Meer acted by Narendra Jha who is a specialist situated in Srinagar, consented to perform an appendectomy on Ikhlaque, the pioneer of a pro-separatist militant group. To maintain a strategic distance from any issues, he plays out the medical procedure at his home, a lot to the embarrassment of his better half Ghazala performed by Tabu, who questions his loyalty.Much to his fate ,the next day, a military strike happens. Hilaal is blamed for giving shelter to terrorists. A shootout results at his home, during which Ikhlaque is killed and Hilaal is taken away for keeping terrorists at his home. The doctor's home is bombarded in this manner to kill other terrorists if they are hiding inside his home.</p>
        <p>A few days after the fact Ghazala's child, Haider acted by Shahid Kapoor, comes back from Aligarh Muslim University to look for answers about his dad's vanishing. Upon appearance, he is stunned to discover his mom singing and snickering alongside her brother in law, Khurram, depicted by Kay Menon. Incapable of comprehending his mom's conduct, he starts scanning for his dad in different police headquarters and confinement camps with the assistance of his love Arshia Lone acted by Shraddha Kapoor. Soon Roohdar played by Irrfan Khan sends him(Haider) a message from his lost dad to Haider saying that Khurram is the person who executed his dad and gives him a weapon to murder Khurram. What rest is the tale of Haider's journey on the way to contempt , envy and uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Haider is by a wide margin the best work of Shahid Kapoor and the Director Vishal Bhardwaj . Shahid Kapoor as Haider has just nailed the performance. Be it the enthusiastic or emotional scenes, outrage or how the kashmiri youth would be feeling or the speech(outrage) he is giving to the people on the road , he has aced it all.. One could state he was destined to act this role. Tabu as Ghazala is lovely and acted magnificently . Kay Menon as Haider's uncle has too acted impeccably and same did Shraddha Kapoor. The one actor who takes the spotlight even with the minimum screen presence is Irrfan Khan as Roohdar . His screen presence is ground-breaking . The way he has acted you are left wanting more from him . All other supporting actors did their part truly well .Be it the faceoff among Shahid and his mom or the face off between  Shahid and Kay Menon every one of them are a demonstration of splendor. Not to forget the two actors who played as Salman Khan fans are brilliant too.</p>
        <p>The film is written by Vishal.The story of Haider is one of a kind and engaging . It isn't the routine romantic family drama sentimental show film. It has its layers added to it which are crafted beautifully. The direction of the movie is done by Vishal Bhardwaj. He has covered all the layers and depth of characters splendidly. One won't be bored even for a while when the movie starts.Cinematography and screenplay are first class. Dialogues are the plus point of movies .Be it the "Chutzpah" thing or the sonnet presented by Irrfan "Jhelum bhi main , Chinar bhi main" , the dialogues are excellent .There are numerous lines which will remain with you after the film ends . The Locations of the movie are amazingly beautiful . The music by Vishal Bhardwaj and lyrics by Gulzar are completely splendid . Be it 'Aao na' by Vishal Dadlani or 'Bismil' by Sukhwinder Singh or 'Gulon mein rang bhare' by Arjit Singh , it is one of the unique albums by the sheer brilliance of Vishal Bhardwaj. . The music adds more beauty to the film plot and suits the course of events properly.The background music too suits impeccably to the film and lifts up a portion of the scenes specially the entry scene of Roohdaar.</p>
        <p>The movie won five National Film Awards including Best Male Playback Singer, Best Dialog, Best Choreography, Best Costume Design, and Best Music Direction. The film holds a 86% rating on audit aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and an IMDB rating of 8.2 .  All said and written , Haider is one of the best cinematic works of the decade so far . It's not the standard mass film which will be delighted in by the majority however it is without a doubt one of the best of the decade . Movies like this which are brilliant in all perspectives are made once in a blue moon .Don't miss it at any expense!</p>
