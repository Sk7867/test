        <h1>STORY OF ELECTRIC BULB AND INVENTION</h1>
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Early Light Bulbs:</h2>
            <figure>

            <p>In 1802, Humphry Davy invented the foremost electric light. He tried different things with electricity and designed an electric battery. At the point when he connected wires to his battery and a bit of carbon, the carbon glowed, creating light. His innovation was known as the Electric Arc light. Even though it created light, it didn't deliver the light for long and was excessively bright for daily use.</p>
            <p>In 1806, Englishman Humphrey Davy presented his electric lamp to the Royal Society. Sadly, the light burnt out rapidly and the race was on to improve it. In 1841, British innovator Frederick DeMoleyns encased his burner in a glass bulb. In 1845, American J.W. Starr got a patent utilizing a vacuum and a carbon burner. English chemist expert Joseph Swan at that point started trying different things with burners of different materials, however none of them truly worked for any period of time.</p>

        <section id="Paragraph-2">
            <h2>Swan's Invention</h2>
            <p>In 1850, English chemist Joseph Swan handled the cost-viability issue of past creators and by 1860 he had built up a light that used carbonized paper filaments instead of ones made of platinum. Swan got a patent in the United Kingdom in 1878, and in February 1879 he showed a working lamp in a lecture in Newcastle, England, as said by the Smithsonian Institution. Like prior interpretations of the light, Swan's fibers were put in a vacuum tube to limit their exposure to oxygen, expanding their life expectancy. But sadly , the vacuum pumps present in that era were not as efficient  as they are currently. Even though his prototype worked well as a demo, it was unrealistic in real use.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Paragraph-3">
            <h2>Edison's Improvements</h2>
            <p>What Edison did was enhance the current thought. He was persuaded he could build up the first practical incandescent lighting system and–with a group of creators and staff–he set out to do only that. Edison understood that the issue with Swan's structure was the fiber. A thin filament fiber with high electrical obstruction would make a light glow on the grounds because it would require just a little current to make it gleam. He exhibited his light bulb in December 1879. Swan consolidated the improvement into his lights and established an electrical lighting company in England. Edison sued for patent encroachment, yet Swan's patent was a solid case, at any rate at least in the United Kingdom, and the two inventors in the long run united and framed Edison-Swan United, which became one of the world's biggest producers of lights, as per the Museum of Unnatural Mystery.</p>
            <p>Swan wasn't the only rival Edison confronted. In 1874, Canadian creators Henry Woodward and Matthew Evans documented a patent for an electric bulb with various sized carbon rods held between electrodes in a glass chamber loaded up with nitrogen. The pair attempted, ineffectively, to popularize their lamps however in the end sold their patent to Edison in 1879.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Paragraph-4">
            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>Edison succeeded and outperformed his opposition in building up a useful and modest lmp, as indicated by the DOE. Edison and his group of analysts in Edison's research laboratory in Menlo Park, N.J., tried in excess of 3,000 structures for bulbs somewhere in the between 1878 and 1880. In November 1879, Edison documented a patent for an electric bulb with a carbon fiber. The patent listed several materials that may be used for the fiber, including cotton, cloth and wood. Edison spent the following year finding the ideal fiber for his new bulb, testing in excess of 6,000 plants to figure out which material would give light for the longest time.</p>
            <p>A while after, in 1879 patent was granted. Edison and his group of researchers found that a carbonized bamboo fiber can burn for over 1,200 hours. Bamboo was used for the fibers in Edison's bulbs until it started to be replaced by longer-enduring materials during the 1880s and mid 1900s. By January 1879, at his research center in Menlo Park, New Jersey, Edison had manufactured his first high opposition, radiant electric bulb.In 1878, Edison concentrated on creating a safe, cheap electric light to replace the gaslight–a test that researchers had been wrestling with throughout the previous 50 years. It worked by passing power through a slender platinum fiber in the glass vacuum bulb, which deferred the fiber from liquefying. In any case, the light just burnt for a couple of brief hours.</p>

        <section id="Paragraph-5">
            <h2>The Company</h2>
            <p>The achievement of Edison's light was followed by the establishing of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of New York in 1880. The organization was begun with financial help from J.P. Morgan and other well off financial specialists of the time. The organization built the first electricity generating stations that would control electrical systems and recently patented bulbs. The first creating station was opened in September 1882 on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan.</p>
            <p>Despite the fact that Edison's initial radiant lighting frameworks had their issues, they were used in various acclaimed occasions such as in the Paris Lighting Exhibition in 1881 and the Crystal Palace in London in 1882. Contenders soon emerged, mainly George Westinghouse, a proponent of AC current. By 1889, AC would come to rule the field, and Edison General Electric Co. joined with another company in 1892 to become General Electric Co.</p>

            <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
            <p>When Edison began working on it, the light bulb had been around for quite a while, just in an alternate structure, DeGraaf clarified. Around 20 innovators from over the world had drafted different patents on it.</p>
            <p>Various inventors for example, William Sawyer and Albon Man, quit, merging their organization with Edison's to shape General Electric, as per the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).</p>
            <p>When Edison passed away on October 18, 1931, Thomas Edison had amassed a record 1,093 patents:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>389 :- The number of patents on electric light and power</li>
                <li>195:-  The number of patents on the phonograph</li>
                <li>150 :-  The number of patents on the telegraph</li>
                <li>141:-  The number of patents on storage batteries</li>
                <li>34:-  The number of patents on the telephone.</li>
            </ul>
